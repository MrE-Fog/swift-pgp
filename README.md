# swift-pgp
A PGP [RFC 4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880) library written purely in Swift<sup>1</sup>. Format PGP signatures, public keys, and UserIDs. This library is public-key-cryptography-implementation-agnostic. That is, you can use swift-pgp with any public-key crypto implementation you want, provided it is either an RSA or  Ed25519 cryptosystem. 

Includes support for Ed25519 public keys.

> 1: Except for SHA hash functions from CommonCrypto.
